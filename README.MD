# UF 101 Form Helper

This project is a simple tool that I created for my own use to allow the simple production of UF101 forms.

It is a plain HTML page with a form which it uses to populate the required fields for the UF101 and uses an OpenMaps map to determine Latitude and Longitude in Degrees Minutes Seconds and then embed that OpenMaps map as the required image.

It performs **no** error checking on fields. You are expected to know that AMSL and AGL are in feet and that radius is in meters.

It has no access to IAA geo zones so you will have to enter the controlled airspace names yourself.

There is a [github pages](https://cuannan.github.io/UF101/) page set up for this project so you don't need to clone it and run it locally. You are, however, entirely welcome to do so. It is provided as-is.
